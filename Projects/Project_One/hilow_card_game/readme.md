# PROJECT: HI LO CARD GAME

**SUMMARY:** HI LO is an an app that allows the user to select whether they believe the next card dealt will be high or low compared to the one displayed. User starts with three lives, and loses one each time they guess HI or LO incorrectly.  If they guess correctly, they earn a point.  User wins the game when they earn five points.

# APPROACH
**TECHNOLOGY USED:** HTML/EJS, CSS, JavaScript/jQuery/


**DESCRIPTION:**
-Basic JavaScript & jQuery:
    -Shuffle cards array to randomly deal cards to user.
    -User interactivity through buttons.

-Vanilla CSS styling


# ETC.
**PLANNED FEATURES:**
-Add functionality for use of betting money from variable stored where the player begins game w/$100.
-Improve responsiveness


### **Problems I need to address w/HILO:**
- [ ] buttons are not inline
- [x] win state not working properly (when player gets 5 points they aren't receiving a win notification)
- [ ] cards are not the same size
- [ ] cards keep loading in same row even if screen is not in view
- [ ] need to decide whether I'm going to incorporate gambling portion (& then what is the game logic I will use?) from the udemy class
- [ ] need button options for playing again, cancel, etc.

#### **Problem-solving approaches:**
- 2 & 5 need to be solved w/javascript, game logic, after decision making
- 1,3,4,6 will be solved by incorporating BS4
